# DECISION-TREE-IMPLEMENTATION


In this project, I built and visualized a Decision Tree using Python and the Scikit-learn library. I used the Iris dataset, which contains features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width for different flower species.I began by importing essential libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. After loading the dataset, I split it into features (X) and target labels (y), then divided the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

I trained a DecisionTreeClassifier on the training data and made predictions on the test set. To evaluate performance, I used metrics like accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.Next, I visualized the decision tree using plot_tree, which helped me understand how the model splits data at each node to make predictions. I also analyzed feature importance to see which features had the most influence on the model's decisions.This task gave me hands-on experience in how decision trees work, how machines learn patterns from data, and how to interpret model behavior visually and statistically.
